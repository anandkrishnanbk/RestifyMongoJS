### RestifyMongoJS
RestifyMongoJS is a very simple sample restify mongojs project for CRUD Operations.

### Run the project
'npm install' to install dependencies.

Set up mongodb on your own and create 'product' db and 'products' user collection with your own document.

Then using my installed restify client and restify server code, we can do get,post,put,delete operations.
