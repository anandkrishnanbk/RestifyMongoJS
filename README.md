### RestifyMongoJS
RestifyMongoJS is a very simple sample restify mongojs project for CRUD Operations.

### Install the project dependencies
`npm install` to install dependencies.

### Run the project
`gulp serve`


Set up mongodb on your own and create 'product' db and 'products' user collection with your own document.

Then using my installed restify client and restify server code, we can do get,post,put,delete operations.

Added sample UI to enter new Product and then query,view,edit,delete products.
